Clone the repository

then **branch**

	$ git branch bobby
	$ git checkout bobby
	$ git push -u origin bobby
	
Get to work


I'll add the assignments to the master week by week (probably) and you can merge to get them

	$ git checkout bobby
	$ git merge master


### IntelliJ

The `.idea` folder is ignored so to get up and running in IDEA, run

	$ sbt gen-idea
	
from the assignment folder.
